        <p>Hi and welcome to my home page.</p>

        <p>I am Joy Bose. I am a Data Scientist currently working at Ericsson, Bangalore. </p>

        <p>I graduated in 2007 with a Ph.D in the APT research group at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Manchester, UK. My supervisors were Steve Furber and Jon Shapiro. Magnus Rattray was my advisor. During my Phd I was working as part of a project to build hardware and software models of scalable neural network architectures and investigate their properties and potential applications. I am involved mainly with the software aspects of the same.  The aim of my PhD research is to understand how reliable systems can be built out of unreliable spiking neural components, by taking the example of sequence learning. I graduated with my PhD on 11 December 2007. </p>
            
        <p>Since my PhD graduation I have been working in industry, most recently at Ericsson, previously at Embibe, Microsoft, Samsung R&D in Bangalore and DAI Limited in Stockport. My recent work has concentrated on various areas related to web browsers and improving the user experience when browsing the web. I currently work in the data intelligence team of Samsung, where my work involves various areas of understanding the user based on various parameters, building a user profile and recommending relevant services to the user. </p>
