<p>Increasing the click rate of web notifications</p>
<p>Jan 2015 - Oct 2016</p>
<p>We present a system to increase the click rate of push notifications, by predicting which categories of notifications the user is more likely to click. For doing this, we build a model that takes the user's past clicks and online behavior as inputs, and outputs the time of day when the user is more likely to click a notification belonging to a particular category. E.g. sports on friday evenings. </p>

<p>Calendar event classification </p>
<p>Jun 2017 - Aug 2018</p>
<p>Built machine learning models to classify calendar data input (short text data) by users into one of predefined categories, in both Korean and English, using an ensemble of machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>Publications</p>
<p>A Personalized Health Recommendation System based on Smartphone Calendar Events (ICOST 2018)</p>

<p>System to extract relevant content on a webpage for reader mode</p>
<p>Aug 2018 - Apr 2019</p>
<p>The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning application to extract content from a webpage based on relevance to the reader and remove ads or boilerplate content. We tried different machine learning algorithms and used a customized version of an internal virtual DOM extractor tool. </p>

<p>Machine learning to predict field labels in an autofill system</p>
<p>Apr - Dec 2019</p>
<p>Built a machine learning model to predict the field labels for the autofill feature in web browsers. Used WinML and saved the model in ONNX format. </p>

<p>Determining the optimal nudges for improving a student's score in standardized tests</p>
<p>Jan - Jun 2020</p>
<p>We used optimization algorithms to identify the optimal parameters where a student could improve their score by a certain amount, based on the historical data of the student. This is used to generate appropriate nudge messages to help the student improve the test scores. The student score in tests using the online learning platform is a function of multiple parameters related to test taking behavior and knowledge in different concepts.</p>
