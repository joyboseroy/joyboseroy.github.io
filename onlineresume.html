<p>Part of team of 4 involved in developing software (using MS Access 97 and Visual Basic for Applications programming) for the seat allocation process (as per the merit list and different reservation quotas) of MBA and MCA candidates in various universities in the province of UP, India. We also operated the software during the actual week of seat allocations.</p>
<p>Also generated a report confirming each admission made and report summaries according to different criteria.  </p>
<p>There were 4 computers and a display (which was a report, updated constantly with seat status as soon as every new admission was made) connected by network over access. Had the locking system in access when each query was updated. It was around 3000 students or more in the merit list for free and paid seats in private and government colleges, with maybe around 50 universities to whom seats were allocated (as per the availability of seats, this information was pre-given). There was a master table, and many queries from the master table for different colleges and other criteria, and reports generated of the number of candidates selected per day per category for each institution etc.</p>
<p>Initially we were given the details of what information will be provided and what the software needs to do, we had to develop the database schema (which tables are needed and their links etc), plan the tables, SQL queries, reports and forms needed, and do the coding to implement the frontend and backend system.</p>
<p>The software was successfully used for seat allocation of over 3000 candidates belonging to different reservation categories to different universities.</p>

<h2>Academic software projects</h2>
<p>2002-07 Neural network simulations for spiking neuron models (PhD research).</p>
<p>Platform: Java and Matlab</p>
<p>Role: Experiments to determine the properties of the neural model and optimisation of the model. Also experiments on neural associative memories.</p>
<p>1. Coded a simulator in Java to simulate firings of bursts of spiking neurons, to study their dynamics. It was event driven, with every spike firing being an event, and global time being recalculated for every event. Used GNUPlot to plot the spike firings (1st year)</p>
<p>2. Coded a simulator in Java with Swing GUI to simulate a N-of-M SDM memory. (1st year)</p>
<p>3. Many experiments in Java to study an unordered N-of-M SDM, rank ordered SDM. In each case, plotted the results using gnuplot. Plotted 3D plots as well of the unordered memories, replicated the results in first N-of-M SDM paper.</p>
<p>4. Coded a Matlab simulator for spiking neurons: ODSHO/RDLIF model (with 2nd order dynamics of neural activation rise and decay) and with neural activations recalculated with discrete timesteps. Plotted the outputs also using Matlab (2nd year)</p>
<p>5. A simulator in C (sw_sw.c) for the Altera NPE simulation, for generating lists of inputs and expected outputs. Also a C simulator for a backpropagation algorithm.</p>
<p>6. Java experiments on neural associative memories perfomance when various input parameters are varied. Switched to plotting with matlab. Also simulating the memory performance in a 5-50 and 10-100 size memory etc, both for a correlation matrix memory (CMM) and sparse distributed memory (SDM) when the significance is kept at 0.9 or 9.99 etc and other small experiments.</p>
<p>7. Java simulator for a sequence machine, elman model and shift register model, both online and offline. Inputs and outputs were by hand, not automated.</p>
<p>8. Matlab simulator for the Elman, shift register and combined models of sequence machine, with experiments to test its performance, here the inputs were aurtomated based on various parameters such as distribution and types of inputs. The outputs were plotted also using Matlab.</p>
<p>9. Matlab simulation of the RDLIF model experiments for the WIRN paper, to study the dynamics of spiking neurons and whether inter-symbol interference affected the performance, and what was the optimal threshold beyond which the neuron spike bursts died out, and in which cases the bursts exploded.</p>
<p>10. Changing Mike's SpikeNet Java simulator for spiking neurons to make it suitable for a sequence machin with RO codes and using the RDLIF model of spiking neuron. Used that simulator to simulate sequences of symbols encoded as RO codes, and also built a equivalent matlab simulator to test if the outputs were equivalent and the Java simulator was working correctly.</p>
<p>11. A way to visualise all the spike timings, coded in Matlab, with the different neural layers plotted on Y-axis with different and the time on X-axis. The output of mike's simulator was passed through a perl program coded by SteveT, which generated lists of times and neuron numbers only, which was input to this plotting program, which then plotted the system outputs.</p>
<p>12. Matlab plots for the further experiments on the combined model, to study its performance for different distributions of the inputs (such as inputs being generated with a 0.8 probability 1 and 0.2 probability 0 on an uniform distribution), for different values of the context sensitivity parameter lambda, the significance factor alpha and memory sizes, and finally plot the results.</p>
<p>13. Java-matlab programs to determine and plot the information content of RO codes of various sizes, and also to study the memory performance with and without errors, and with the desensitisation factor being varied, and size of memory being varied etc.</p>
<p>14. Did experiments on the spiking neural memory with some (20-30%) irregularity in timings to see how well the system could cope.</p>
